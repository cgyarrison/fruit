# Analysis of tweets from @pomological

Hello! Welcome to a very important project. I'm analyzing tweets from "old fruit pictures" (@pomological) to see which old fruits people are most impressed with. We've got all the fruits: kumquats; oranges; and lots of apples. I particularly like the apples, but no one else seems to.

Anyway, consider this a placeholder as I patch together what's becoming a rather sprawling little project. Enjoy this enigmatic first graph from my Exploratory Data Analysis:
